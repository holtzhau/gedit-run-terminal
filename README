GEdit Run Terminal
==================

A plugin for GEdit that combines the functionality of the external tools plugin with an embedded gnome-terminal.
The result is a terminal that executes commands at your will, e.g. single keystroke python execution.

Features:
---------
-Click on numbered errors to go to position in file. (also for commands such as "rgrep -in test .")
-Right click on the terminal for more options, including experimental right panel support.
